    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <h3>How does UPDATE work?</h3>
    <p>In the home screen, there are multiple different photos that represent different categories of entertainment. Click on the photo of the category you want to see more about, and it will take you to a website that has all the latest news about that category!
        And if you want to go back to the home screen, simply press the left arrow at the top of the screen, and it'll take you back there no problem!
    </p>
    <h3>Does UPDATE allow me to watch certain movies, TV shows, or anime?</h3>
    <p>To put it bluntly, no, UPDATE doesn't allow that. UPDATE is simply a site where you can keep up with your favorite pieces of entertainment, it's not a place where you can pirate anime and movies.
        We at UPDATE do actually support piracy to an extent, but this isn't the place to do it, otherwise we'd have to change the name of the site to something else. 
        If you want to pirate anime, movies, or TV shows, there are plenty of other websites that allow you to do that, just hope you can find one that doesn't have ads or scams.
